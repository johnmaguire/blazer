# Changelog

Going forward from v0.6.0 (the first new version after the move to https://github.com/Backblaze/blazer), all notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `(*base.B2).CreateKeyMultiBucket` and the `b2.BucketIDs` `KeyOption`
  for creating Multi-Bucket Application Keys via `(*b2.Client).CreateKey`.
  Multi-bucket keys are created against the B2 Native API v4
  `b2_create_key` endpoint.

### Changed

- `b2_authorize_account` and the other general API calls now target the
  B2 Native API v4. A restricted key's scope is parsed from the v4
  response shape under `apiInfo.storageApi.allowed`: a `buckets` array of
  `{id, name}` objects in place of the singular `bucketId`/`bucketName`,
  plus `namePrefix`. This allows the client to authenticate with
  Multi-Bucket Application Keys, which the v3 endpoint does not accept.
- `(*base.B2).CreateKey` and `(*b2.Bucket).CreateKey` continue to
  target the v3 `b2_create_key` endpoint and produce legacy
  single-bucket keys. This preserves wire-level compatibility with
  clients that have not adopted v4.

## [0.7.2] - 2025-01-23

### Changed

- Removed unused `bonfire` and `pyre` code, greatly reducing the number of dependencies and the amount of work required to keep them up to date.
- Restructured the repository as a [Go workspace](https://go.dev/ref/mod#workspaces) and moved the sole remaining third-party dependency into `bin/b2keys`.
